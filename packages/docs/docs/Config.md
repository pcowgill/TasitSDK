In an Expo app, you can use a combination of [`dotenv-flow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-flow), the `extra` section the Expo config file (`app.json` / `app.config.js` / `app.config.ts`), and `expo-constants` to pass configuration through to `tasit`.

Here's an example app using this approach to set the right Gnosis Safe relayer URL to use.
